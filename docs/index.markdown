OpenCXT Phone gives you a simple and complete picture of the health of your call centers and toll free numbers across the globe. Our key differentiators are:

- We offer a red carpet service. You can call the private number of your account manager at 2am, and we will be happy to support you
- We go all the extra miles for you. When the voice quality is poor, our AI will tell you what is probably wrong. Want to know how your call center is answering the phone? We give you a transcript of every call. Want something else? Yes, we can!
- Tired of the monopoly feeling of the legacy CX testing companies? We offer a great service, a great product, and a very, very competitive price. Check us out.

Do you already have a CX testing contract with another company? Do you want a better service? Do you want a better product? Do you want to cut costs? Send us an email and we will show you how different we are: [info@opencxt.com](mailto:info@opencxt.com).
